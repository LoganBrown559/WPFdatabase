# WPFdatabase
My first attempt at plugging an Access database to a C# WPF application.

This was a struggle bus at first, as I did not realize that my Access database was 2007.
None the less, after solving that it was as simple as solving how to put text onto a textblock through code.
After implementing the first button, the second was easy. Just copy, paste, and edit about 4 things, and done!
